Activity lifecycle and state
============================
#### Task2
##### In a previous task, when we rotate our device, the activity is recreated and the messagereply and header_reply textview value is reset to null.<br> So in this task onSaveInstanceState() method has been implemented 
to preserve the instance state of messagereply and header_reply textviews.
